We believe [our clients](/clients) should be ‘wowed’ by what we achieve; this may be why our client retention is twice the industry average and over 80% new business comes through referral. If asked to sum up what makes Spark different, clients would probably say we ‘give a damn’. Making sure your campaigns work and ultimately deliver value is what drives us.
